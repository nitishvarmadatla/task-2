Summary of Analysis & Key Findings
The analysis revealed that while overall sales are strong, profitability is a significant concern that needs strategic attention.


Segment Dominance: The Consumer segment is the largest driver of sales, accounting for over 50% of the total.


Profitability Issues: Certain products, despite having high sales, yield very low profits. The 

"Sum of Profit by Sub-Category" bar chart clearly shows that products like 'Copiers' and 'Accessories' are highly profitable, while others are not.


Lagging Profit Growth: The "Sum of Sales and Sum of Profit by Year" line chart indicates that while sales have grown consistently from 2016 to 2019, profit growth has been much slower, suggesting shrinking margins.
